:Abstract: We use a complete sample of about 140000 galaxies from the Sloan
    Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) to study the size distribution of galaxies and its
    dependence on their luminosity, stellar mass and morphological type. The
    large SDSS data base provides statistics of unprecedented accuracy. For each
    type of galaxy, the size distribution at given luminosity (or stellar mass)
    is well described by a log-normal function, characterized by its median and
    dispersion :math:`\sigma_{\rm lnR}`. For late-type galaxies, there is a
    characteristic luminosity at :math:`M_{r,0} \sim -20.5` (assuming h= 0.7)
    corresponding to a stellar mass :math:`M_0 \sim 10^{10.6} M_{\rm solar}`.
    Galaxies more massive than :math:`M_0` have and :math:`\sigma_{\rm lnR} \sim
    0.3`, while less massive galaxies have and :math:`\sigma_{\rm lnR} \sim
    0.5`. For early-type galaxies, the relation is significantly steeper, , but
    the :math:`\sigma_{\rm lnR}`-M relation is similar to that of bright
    late-type galaxies. Faint red galaxies have sizes quite independent of their
    luminosities. We use simple theoretical models to interpret these results.
    The observed relation for late-type galaxies can be explained if the
    fraction of baryons that form stars is as predicted by the standard feedback
    model. Fitting the observed :math:`\sigma_{\rm lnR}`-M relation requires in
    addition that the bulge/disc mass ratio be larger in haloes of lower angular
    momentum and that the bulge material transfers part of its angular momentum
    to the disc. This can be achieved if bulge formation occurs so as to
    maintain a marginally stable disc. For early-type galaxies, the observed
    :math:`\sigma_{\rm lnR}`-M relation is inconsistent with formation through
    single major mergers of present-day discs. It is consistent with formation
    through repeated mergers, if the progenitors have properties similar to
    those of faint ellipticals or Lyman break galaxies and merge from relatively
    strongly bound orbits.

that mentioned at the beginning of Section 2.3, and an additional check that a
Petrosian radius was found. Returns 142,316 objects instead of the 168,958
